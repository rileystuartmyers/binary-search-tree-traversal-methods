Creates a BST with three methods of searching, including postfix, infix, and prefix. 

All three traversal methods simply use recursion, and depending on the method above, print current node's data before, between, or after traversal of node's children.

Input files take the form of command lines, along with input lines with any number of integers, each separated by a space.
The command lines allow for insertion, removal, and traversal.

Given the list of integers as input, the output will compare each traversal method's output with the input and return which, if any, methods match. If none, output is 'False'.
